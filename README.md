# Customer Support Chat Data Analysis

This project analyzes customer support chat data for "QuickHelp" using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify common customer concerns, sentiment trends, and recurring topics. The analysis aims to help QuickHelp streamline support services and improve chatbot responses.

## Introduction

This project is focused on analyzing customer support queries to:

1. Identify common issues and recurring topics.
2. Analyze customer sentiment to enhance response effectiveness.
3. Provide recommendations for improving customer support.

Using NLP techniques, we process and analyze chat logs to uncover insights that can help optimize support workflows.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains customer support chat logs with fields such as:

1. customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. chat_date: Timestamp of the chat.
3. message_text: The text of the customer query or support message.


## Analysis Steps

### Data Preprocessing
1. Tokenization: Split chat messages into tokens (words).
2. Stopwords Removal: Remove common stopwords for better feature extraction.
3. Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form.
4. POS Tagging: Tag words with their grammatical roles to observe patterns in customer queries.
